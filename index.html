    <p>Arguably, snake season is year-round in Arizona, a state known for its rattlers. 
      But baby rattlesnakes are born<br> in July and August, making these two months especially 
      dangerous for hikers, gardeners, children and others<br> at high risk of exposure to rattlesnake bites.</p>

    <p>So far this year, 74 rattlesnake bites to humans have been reported to the Arizona Poison and Drug<br> Information Center. 
      Based at the University of Arizona College of Pharmacy, the center serves the entire state<br> of Arizona with the exception of Maricopa County,
       providing free and confidential poison and medication<br> information to callers around the clock.</p>
    <p>Specialists answering the phones at the center regularly receive calls from Arizonans of all ages who don't<br> realize they were bitten by a rattler.
       The poison center urges anyone who feels a mysterious sting, pinch or bite<br> while outdoors to immediately call the center at 800-222-1222.</p>
    <p>"We will ask a few questions that will help you either identify possible snakebite or eliminate it," said Keith<br> Boesen, director of the Arizona Poison
       and Drug Information Center. "With snakebite, the sooner the medical<br> treatment, the better the outcome, so calling us right away can make a very big 
       difference for the victims and<br> the medical teams treating them."</p>

    <p>The center advises anyone who might come across paths with rattlesnakes to be aware of these five things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Baby rattlesnakes range in length from 6 to 12 inches and are easily camouflaged by brush and grass.</li>
      <li>Baby rattlesnakes are rattleless until they first shed their skins, so there will be no infamous "chica-<br>chica" sound before they strike.</li>
      <li>Despite their impish size, baby snakes have enough venom to be very dangerous if they bite a human.</li>
      <li>Adult rattlesnakes do not always rattle an audible warning before or while they are biting.</li>
      <li>It's a good idea to call the poison center if you notice an unidentified small cut or wound, even if you<br> feel no pain. 
        With the lack of telltale rattle warning, people can be bitten without knowing what has<br> happened until they notice their symptoms
         and attribute them to a snakebite.</li>
    </ol>
